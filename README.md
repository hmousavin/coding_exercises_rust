# Coding Exercises: Rust

This repository contains solutions to coding exercises from the **"Coding Exercises: Rust"** course. The exercises aren't particularly difficult, but they are highly relevant for learning how to solve problems in an idiomatic Rust style. The focus is on core Rust concepts such as parsing/conversions, iterators, and error handling.

## Purpose

In each exercise, I've discovered new techniques that are specific to Rust's design principles. These exercises serve as a practical approach to mastering Rust's unique syntax and concepts. Along the way, you'll learn:

- **Error Handling:** Managing results and errors using Rust's powerful type system.
- **Iterators:** Leveraging Rust's iterator traits for concise and readable code.
- **Parsing and Conversions:** Handling string conversions and parsing data efficiently in Rust.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the exercises using `cargo test` to validate the solutions.
3. Modify and extend the tests as necessary to explore edge cases and improve the robustness of the code.
